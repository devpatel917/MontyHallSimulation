# MontyHallSimulation


Simulating the famous Monty Hall problem in python. 

Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, nothing. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has nothing. He then says to you, “Do you want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

It would be naive to assume that there is a 50 percent change of 


As we find through this simulation, if you switch, you have roughly a 2/3 chance of winning the car.
If you stick to your original choice you have roughly a 1/3 chance of winning the car.
